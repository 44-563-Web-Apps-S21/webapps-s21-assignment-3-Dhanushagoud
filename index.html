        <p>
            Dancing is a stress Buster well for me it is.To be honest definitely one of the best forms of exercies where you get to burn a lot of calories by doing something fun rather than pushing and forcing yourself in gym or anything else for the sake of fitness.It canbe enjoyable way to interact with other people.Its great way to overcome shyness,anxiety,insecurities ect.
