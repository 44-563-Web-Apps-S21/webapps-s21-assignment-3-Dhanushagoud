            <h2> Programming Language</h2>
            <blockquote> Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run as fast as possible, and it may be regarded as the lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is possible to write programs directly in machine code, managing individual bits and calculating numerical addresses and constants manually is tedious and error-prone.</blockquote>
